When you're facing cancer, many changes can happen to your body, and sometimes, your thinking can be affected too. This is often called "chemobrain" or "brain fog," but it's important to know that these terms don't tell the whole story. The medical term for these changes is **Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment (CRCI)**, and it's a real and common challenge for many people with cancer.1

CRCI isn't just about memory loss; it can make it harder to focus, find the right words, plan tasks, or even do several things at once.1 These changes can make everyday activities feel much harder and more tiring.3

### **Why Does CRCI Happen?**

While chemotherapy is a known factor, CRCI can actually be caused by many things related to cancer and its treatments 1:

* **The cancer itself:** Even before treatment starts, the cancer can cause changes in your body that affect your brain, especially if it's a brain tumor.3  
* **Other cancer treatments:** This includes radiation therapy (especially to the brain), surgery and anesthesia, hormone therapy, targeted therapies, and immunotherapy.3  
* **Other factors:** Things like fatigue, sleep problems, pain, stress, anxiety, depression, other medications you might be taking, and even other health conditions (like diabetes) can also make CRCI worse.1

Understanding that CRCI has many possible causes can help you realize that your symptoms are valid and not "all in your head".4 It's a measurable, biological issue.4

### **How Common Is It?**

CRCI is very common. It can affect people at any point in their cancer journey:

* **Before treatment:** Up to 30% of patients might notice cognitive changes even before they start chemotherapy.9  
* **During treatment:** A large number of patients, up to 75%, experience CRCI during active treatment.11  
* **After treatment:** For many, symptoms improve, but for a significant number—up to 35%—these changes can last for months or even years after treatment ends.6

Knowing how common CRCI is can help you feel less alone and more confident in discussing your experiences with your healthcare team.7

## **I. Decoding Your Cognitive Shifts: Pinpointing Specific Symptoms**

Moving beyond general terms like "brain fog," it's helpful to identify the specific ways CRCI might be affecting you. This can help you understand your experience better and explain it clearly to others.

**Table 1: Common Cognitive Challenges and What They Feel Like**

| Cognitive Challenge (Specific Term) | What it Feels Like (Patient Description) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Memory Lapses** | Forgetting names, recent conversations, where common items (like keys or wallet) are placed, or why you walked into a room. You might also struggle to recall details of a story or event you just heard.1 |
| **Attention & Focus** | Difficulty concentrating on tasks, conversations, or reading. You might feel easily distracted, have a shorter attention span, or find yourself losing track of what's happening around you.1 |
| **Processing Speed** | Feeling like your thinking is slower than usual. It might take you longer to understand new information, solve problems, or complete tasks that used to be easy.3 |
| **Executive Function** | Problems with planning, organizing, and making decisions. You might struggle with multi-tasking (e.g., trying to cook and answer the phone at the same time), initiating tasks, or switching between different activities.1 |
| **Word Finding** | Difficulty finding the right words to express yourself, even for common objects or ideas. You might experience more "tip-of-the-tongue" moments or substitute words.1 |

This table can help you put words to what you're feeling, which is a great first step in talking about it.

For a more in-depth self-assessment, you might explore tools like the MASCC COG-IMPACT. This is a special self-report tool designed to help you assess how CRCI affects different parts of your life. It has 55 questions across eight areas of functioning and was developed by experts to help both patients and healthcare providers understand CRCI better.15 It's available for free to patients and healthcare professionals on the MASCC website.15

## **II. The Power of Observation and Tracking: Your Cognitive Journal**

Keeping a "Cognitive Journal" is one of the most powerful tools you have. It helps you systematically track your symptoms, identify what might trigger them, notice when you feel most or least sharp, and discover strategies that help.3 This personal data is incredibly valuable for discussions with your healthcare team.

In your journal, try to record:

* **When** your memory or thinking troubles happen.10  
* **What you were doing** at that moment.10  
* **The specific type of trouble** you had (e.g., couldn't remember a name, lost focus).13  
* **When you first noticed** these symptoms.13  
* **Any medicines** you took, the time of day, and the situation.3  
* **What seemed to make the changes better or worse**.3  
* **Any other related symptoms** like fatigue, trouble sleeping, pain, or stress.3

This journal helps turn your feelings into clear information. It can show patterns that even formal tests might miss, making your experience more concrete and easier to discuss with your doctor.3

**Table 2: Cognitive Journal Template for Daily Tracking**

| Date & Time | Specific Cognitive Challenge | Description of Situation/Task | Severity (1-5 Scale) | Potential Triggers/Contributing Factors | Strategies Attempted | Did it Help? (Yes/No/Partial) | Notes/Observations |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| \[e.g., 2024-03-15, 3:30 PM\] | Word-finding difficulty | Trying to explain a recipe to my spouse | 4 (Significantly disruptive) | Feeling tired, just took pain medication | Took a deep breath, tried to rephrase sentence | Partial | Felt very frustrated, spouse had to guess the word. |
| \[e.g., 2024-03-16, 10:00 AM\] | Difficulty multitasking | Answering the phone while cooking breakfast | 5 (Completely lost track) | High stress from upcoming appointment | Put down phone, focused on cooking, called back later | Yes | Realized I need to avoid complex tasks while on the phone. |
| \[e.g., 2024-03-17, 9:00 AM\] | Memory lapse for names | Introduced to a new colleague, forgot their name immediately | 3 (Noticeable, but recovered) | Lack of sleep last night | Repeated their name aloud, made a mental note | Partial | Still felt embarrassed, but remembered later. |
| \[e.g., 2024-03-18, 2:00 PM\] | Slowed processing speed | Filling out a medical form online | 4 (Took much longer than usual) | Feeling mentally fatigued after morning activities | Took a 15-minute break, simplified the task | Yes | Break helped clear my head, but still slow. |
| \[e.g., 2024-03-19, 11:00 AM\] | Executive dysfunction | Struggling to plan my errands for the day | 3 (Disorganized) | Overwhelmed by too many options | Broke down tasks into smaller steps, wrote a list | Yes | List helped, but still felt mentally drained afterwards. |

By regularly reviewing your journal, you can spot patterns. For example, you might notice that your thinking is always foggier in the late afternoon, or after certain medications. This helps you plan your day better and avoid mentally demanding tasks when you know you won't be at your sharpest.3

## **III. Effective Communication with Your Care Team**

Talking about cognitive changes can be tough, but it's crucial. Your healthcare team, especially your oncologist, needs to know what you're going through to help you.

### **Preparing for Your Appointments: Making the Most of Your Time**

Appointments can be short, so being prepared helps you get the most out of them.

* **Bring your Cognitive Journal:** This is your most important tool. It provides real-life examples of your symptoms.3  
* **List all your medications:** Include prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, and supplements. Some might be affecting your thinking.3  
* **Write down your questions:** This helps you remember everything you want to ask.3  
* **Bring a trusted friend or family member:** They can help you remember what's discussed, take notes, and share their observations of your cognitive changes.3  
* **Explain the impact on your daily life:** Be ready to describe how CRCI affects your work, hobbies, social life, and ability to care for yourself.3  
* **Mention related symptoms:** Don't forget to tell them about fatigue, sleep problems, pain, or stress, as these can be connected.3

**Table 3: Essential Information to Gather Before Your Appointment**

| Category | Information to Prepare | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Cognitive Journal** | Detailed log of symptoms, triggers, times, and strategies. | Provides specific, real-world examples and patterns of cognitive changes. |
| **Medication List** | All prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, herbs, vitamins, and supplements, with dosages. | Helps identify potential medication-related contributions to cognitive issues. |
| **Written Questions** | A list of specific questions you want to ask your doctor. | Ensures all concerns are addressed and guides the conversation effectively. |
| **Trusted Companion** | A friend or family member who can observe and help remember details. | Offers an objective perspective on changes and assists with information retention. |
| **Impact on Daily Life** | How CRCI affects school, work, hobbies, social life, and ability to care for self/family. | Shows the real-world effect of CRCI, highlighting the need for support. |
| **Related Symptoms** | Any other symptoms like fatigue, pain, sleep issues, or mood changes. | Provides a full picture of your well-being and potential contributing factors. |

### **Describing Your Symptoms Clearly: What to Say**

When you talk to your care team, try to be as specific as possible. Instead of just saying "I have brain fog," use examples from your journal.  
Here are some ways to start the conversation:

* "I've been having a lot of trouble with \[specific challenge, e.g., word-finding\] lately. For example, \[give a specific example from your journal, like 'yesterday I couldn't remember the word for "refrigerator" while talking to my spouse'\]." 3  
* "I've noticed this is particularly bad \[time of day, e.g., 'in the late afternoon'\] or when I am \[trigger, e.g., 'feeling very tired'\]." 3  
* "These changes are really making it hard for me to \[daily activity, e.g., 'do my job effectively' or 'follow recipes'\], and it's making me feel \[emotion, e.g., 'frustrated' or 'anxious'\]." 3  
* "I've tried \[strategy, e.g., 'taking more breaks'\], and it seems to \[help/not help\]." 3

### **Asking the Right Questions: Guiding the Conversation**

Don't hesitate to ask questions. Here are some examples:

* "Am I at risk for changes in memory, thinking, or focus?" 3  
* "When might these changes happen? How long are they likely to last?" 3  
* "Are there other medical problems or medicines that could be causing my symptoms?" 3  
* "Is there treatment for my symptoms? What is the best treatment?" 3  
* "What can I do to help improve my memory/thinking?" 3  
* "Should I see a specialist, like a neuropsychologist or a rehabilitation therapist? Can you recommend one?" 1

### **Advocating for Yourself: Seeking Support**

Remember, your experience is valid, even if tests don't show severe problems.3 If you feel your concerns aren't being fully addressed, don't give up. You have the right to seek further evaluation and support. Your doctor might refer you to specialists like neurologists or neuropsychologists for more specific testing or treatments.6 Cognitive rehabilitation, which helps you cope with symptoms, is often provided by a neuropsychologist.13 Support groups and counseling can also be very helpful.17

## **IV. Moving Forward: Keeping Your Brain Sharp**

While CRCI can be challenging, there are many ways to manage symptoms and improve your thinking. These include things like regular exercise, mindfulness practices, cognitive training (like brain exercises), and practical tips such as using daily planners and setting routines.1 Maintaining a healthy lifestyle with good nutrition and sleep also plays a big role.3

Now that you know how to track and talk about your cognitive changes, let's look at some ways to fix your cognitive problems and KEEP your brain sharp.
